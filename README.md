# Git History and Main Commands

## Intro

Git is a version control system that allows developers to track changes made to a project over time. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for use in the development of the Linux kernel. Since then, it has become one of the most widely used version control systems in the world. In this ReadMe, we'll explore the history of Git and some of its main commands.
History of Git

Git was created in response to a need for a better version control system for the Linux kernel. Prior to Git, the kernel was maintained using a version control system called BitKeeper. However, when the company that created BitKeeper changed its licensing terms, Torvalds decided to create his own version control system.

Git was designed with a number of key features in mind, including:

    * __Speed__: Git was designed to be fast, even when working with large codebases.

    * __Distributed__: Unlike centralized version control systems like Subversion, Git allows each developer to have their own copy of the entire codebase. This makes it easier to work offline and enables more flexible workflows.

    * __Branching and merging__: Git makes it easy to create and merge branches, which allows developers to work on multiple features or bug fixes simultaneously.

    * __Security__: Git uses cryptographic hashes to ensure that data is not tampered with or corrupted.

Since its creation, Git has become one of the most widely used version control systems in the world. It's used by companies of all sizes, from small startups to large enterprises.

## Main Commands

Here are some of the main Git commands that you'll use on a regular basis:

    * __git init__: Initializes a new Git repository in your current directory.

    * __git add__: Adds changes to your staging area. You can specify individual files or use git add . to add all changes.

    * __git commit__: Commits your changes to the repository. You should include a descriptive commit message to explain the changes you've made.

    * __git push__: Pushes your local changes to a remote repository, such as GitHub.

    * __git pull__: Pulls changes from a remote repository into your local repository.

    * __git status__: Shows the current status of your repository, including any changes that have been made but not yet committed.

    * __git log__: Shows a log of all commits that have been made to the repository.

    * __git branch__: Lists all branches in the repository. Use git branch <branch-name> to create a new branch.

    * __git merge__: Merges changes from one branch into another. This is useful when you want to incorporate changes from a feature branch into your main branch.

These are just a few of the many Git commands available. As you become more comfortable with Git, you'll likely start using more advanced commands and workflows. But even these basic commands will be enough to get you started with Git and version control.
