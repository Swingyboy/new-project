#Git History and Main Commands

##Intro

Git is a version control system that allows developers to track changes made to a project over time. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for use in the development of the Linux kernel. Since then, it has become one of the most widely used version control systems in the world. In this ReadMe, we'll explore the history of Git and some of its main commands.
History of Git

Git was created in response to a need for a better version control system for the Linux kernel. Prior to Git, the kernel was maintained using a version control system called BitKeeper. However, when the company that created BitKeeper changed its licensing terms, Torvalds decided to create his own version control system.
